Indie Studio is the last C++ project of your second year in Epitech. It consists in programming a 3D video game with real tools. You will have to choose a game to make. All your game will have to feature specific functionnalities and to offer a real gaming experience.

Bomberman is one of the most famous video game. With more that 70 franchises, since the first version on MSX, ZX Spectrum and Sharp MZ-700 in 1983 until the lasts versions on PlayStation Network, WiiWare and Xbox Live Arcade commercialized in 2010 ; more than 10 millions units have been sold. We decided to use as a reference, the video game Neo Bomberman, commercialized on Neo Geo and on MVS systems in 1997.

Think simplicity and with efficiency. Itâ€™s a basic advice, but keep it in mind. If things
gets out of control, get back, keep it easy, think again and ask questions if needed. The
project is not complex, but if you want to succeed, you have to understand how the
different parts are put together!
